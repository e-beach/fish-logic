# fish-logic

This plugin replaces the tokens `&&` and `||` with `;and` and `;or` when you type them in on the command line.
This may be useful in copy-pasted install scripts that use `&&` to chain commands, or if you are used to bash syntax.

## Install

With [fisherman]

```
fisher e-beach/fish-logic
```

## TODO
- [ ] Add demo with asciinema
- [ ] prevent quoted expressions like `'&&'` from being expanded.
- [ ] Add tests
